I really like the idea of limited space meaning like a planar collapse.
Maybe you are like trying to keep the plane from collapsing.

after X trigger dialog about this not working needing to study to figure
out another way of dealing with this problem. -> Research resource with a
study  button to increase that resource

After a delay research starts to decay get prompted to maybe make a library
to organize the information. -> unlock lumber resource with chop button.

enough wood -> build library. 

research unlock -> anchor trees. Slow down the rate of decline.

how should we trigger dialogs?
